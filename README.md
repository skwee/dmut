#### Intro
dmut - Is a content pipeline editor tool for 2D sprites. It allows you to take a sprite created by a designer, break it into frames, define animation and add frames to animations. At the end you can export the created data to a convenient binary format that stores the animations and can be easily loaded by your game.

This is still a Work in Progress.
