#### DISCLAIMER
THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS

Everything is subject to change

#### INTRO
dmut - Is a content pipeline animation editor tool for 2D sprites. It comes as a layer between the artist and you game/simulation code.

#### MOTIVATION
duh, I just needed an animation editor for 2D sprites. Apparently there is no unified format or editor for that stuff, and when there is no tool to do the job, you just make one.

Fell free to share your ideas and needs about what would you like to see in the editor and maybe Ill put that.
